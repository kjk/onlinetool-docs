We try to be as close as possible to notepad2 but there are differences.

I estimate we implement more than 80% of notepad2 features.

Major reasons for differences:
* features that are not possible to implement in the browser. Mostly deep integration with Windows
* differences between Scintilla editing component used by notepad2 and Code Mirror 6 editing component used by us
* features that I haven't yet implemented

Feel free to [request features](https://github.com/kjk/onlinetool-docs/labels/notepad2) that are most important to you.
