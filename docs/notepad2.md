# notepad2 for web

[notepad2 for web](https://onlinetool.io/notepad2/) is a web browser re-implementation of [notepad2](https://github.com/zufuliu/notepad2), a lightweight text / code editor for Windows.

We try to faithfully recreate notepad2, within the limits of what's possible in the browser.
