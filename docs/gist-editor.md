# Gist Editor

[Gist Editor](https://onlinetool.io/gisteditor/) is a better editor / manager for GitHub Gists.

Log in with GitHub to:
* edit existing gists
* create new gists
* delete existing gists

Or use it without logging as a lightweight text / code editor in which case we save files in the browser's localStorage.
